But many bird species across the world are isolated in difficult-to-access habitats. With physical monitoring difficult, sound recording is a solution to sicentists. Known as bioacoustic monitoring, this approach could provide a :green[passive, low labor, and cost-effective] strategy for studying endangered bird populations""")
